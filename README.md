<p align="justify"> 
  In this phase we were tasked with creating a user-friendly digital assistant that accepts and edits skills. 
  This was achieved by creating csv and skill handlers that read and store skills into a database.In addition to this, we also implemented algorithms that are able to detect typographical errors which would be the first step to a context free grammar.
  All this improvements as a whole have brought us closer to answering our research questions: 
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Research Question 1: </strong>How to create a user friendly chatbot that accepts and edits template based skills?</li>
    <li><strong>Research Question 2: </strong>How would the increasing size of skills reflect on the performance of the digital assistant?</li>
  </ol>
